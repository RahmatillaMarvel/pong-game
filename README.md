## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles controlled by keyboard inputs, a bouncing ball, and a scoreboard to keep track of player scores.

## Features

- **Paddles**: Control the paddles using keyboard inputs (Player 1: Up and Down arrows, Player 2: W and S keys).
- **Ball**: The ball bounces off the walls and paddles, with its speed increasing after each paddle hit.
- **Scoreboard**: Keep track of player scores and display them at the top of the screen.

### Usage
